Natural Language Generation for Content Creation
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate summaries and find relevant images or documents for a given topic.
It supports two modes:

Image + Label Mode â€“ Matches a topic with the most relevant image and generates a summary from its associated label text.

Text Document Mode â€“ Finds and summarizes the most relevant document for the topic.

The system uses TF-IDF for semantic relevance ranking and extractive summarization for content generation.

ðŸš€ Features
Topic-based document ranking using cosine similarity.

Automatic text summarization with NLTK.

Image retrieval based on label text similarity.

Flask API endpoints for integration with a frontend.

CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Libraries:

nltk â€“ Tokenization, stopword removal, summarization

scikit-learn â€“ TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity

Pillow â€“ Image handling

Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS (served from Flaskâ€™s static folder)
